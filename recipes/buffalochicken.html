<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Gather all ingredients. </li>
    <li>Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; 
        lightly coat with cooking spray. Using a serrated bread knife,
        cut rolls in half horizontally, keeping top halves and bottom
        halves intact; place bottom half of rolls, cut-side up, on prepared
        baking sheet. </li>
    <li>Sprinkle 3/4 cup of the cheese evenly over bottom half of rolls. </li>
    <li>Stir together warmed chicken, hot sauce, ranch dressing,
        and 3 tablespoons of the ranch dressing mix in a large bowl 
        until evenly coated. </li>
    <li>Top bottom half of rolls evenly with chicken mixture;
        sprinkle with remaining 3/4 cup cheese. </li>
    <li>Place top half of rolls over cheese. Brush tops and
        sides of rolls with melted butter. Sprinkle tops of
        rolls evenly with remaining 1/2 tablespoon ranch dressing mix.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, tops of rolls
        are golden brown, and chicken mixture is heated through, about
        10 minutes. Remove from oven, cut into 12 sliders and serve immediately. </li>
